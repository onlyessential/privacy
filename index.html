Only Apps prioritizes your privacy. None of our applications collect, store, or share personal data. All apps function entirely offline, and no user information is transmitted to us or any third party.

Log Data

Only Apps does not collect or store any log data. We do not track your activities, usage patterns, or device details.

Cookies

Only Apps does not use cookies or any tracking mechanisms. None of our apps store data on your device for tracking or analytics purposes.

Security

Because Only Apps does not collect personal data, request Internet permission, or integrate with third-party services, there are no risks of data leaks, unauthorized access, or misuse. You can use our apps with confidence, knowing your privacy is fully protected.

Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page. We encourage you to review this document periodically for updates.
